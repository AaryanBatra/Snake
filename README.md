# Snake
The classic game snake, remade in Python

This was my first ever project made in Python.
Previous to this, I had to experience with Python and my only coding experience was a year in Java. 
I wanted to challenge myself by making a benchmark project, and so I decided to make Snake, a classic and popular game that 
is simple enoguh to code if you're an experienced developer but still holds challenges for more beginer programmers. While 
I initially looked online for tutorials on how to code, I really wanted to challenge myself; so I decided to shoot completely in the dark
and follow no tutorials. I built the game completely from the ground up with no knowledge of python and little algorithm experience.
It was a rigorous process but I am proud of the outcome. The other file in this repository is the python file that contains the code I wrote for this project
